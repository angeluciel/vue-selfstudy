# vue-selfstudy

I'm trying to learn a bit of vue by myself this time!

# Recommended setup

I use [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar).

## Project Setup

in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

to start the project:

```
npm run dev
```
